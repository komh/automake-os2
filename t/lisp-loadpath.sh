# The story here is that at least in Emacs 21, -L foo -L bar ends up
# with bar before foo in load-path. The invocation in the .el.elc rule
# in lisp.am correctly uses -L $(builddir) -L $(srcdir), and thus the
# test below ends up failing. So skip the test on such old Emacs; no
# need to work around in the code.
#
# At least as of Emacs 24, -L foo -L bar preserves command line order,
# so foo is before bar in load-path, and all is well.
#
# Situation with Emacs 22 and 23 is unknown, so play it safe and skip
# the test for them too.
#
# Meanwhile, Emacs sets the EMACS envvar to t in subshells.
# If that's what we've got, use "emacs" instead.
